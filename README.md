# TRADE_NEGATIVE_CORRELATION

Cryptocurrency trading using a proprietary algorithm that includes a standard deviation filter and portfolio balancing.
It is an extension of the concept contained in the project:

Note: the algorithm contained in the scripts does not take into account the difference between buy and sell offers, which may affect the generation of losses while tokens have low liquidity

I disclaim any liability for damages resulting from the use of my scripts. All scripts in my repositories are for demonstration purposes only. The result of my work does not constitute advice under international law and national laws applicable in individual countries

Together!... with a creative idea for outstanding progress in economic development
